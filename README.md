A basic model of a perceptron algorithm performing a sort on two data groups utilizing **numpy** and **matplotlib**.

**According to Wikipedia:**
"In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.[1] It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector."
